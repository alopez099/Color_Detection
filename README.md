# Color Detection System-on-Chip

Implemented a SoC style integrated Processing System (PS) and a Programmable Logic (PL) to record object color data. Used for Object Detection. 

## Features

- Set Pmod communication with Zybo via IÂ²C protocol with ADC conversion for enhancing data acquisition & control systems
- Captured color data from everyday objects for use with Zybo FPGA via Diligent COLOR Pmod for use with object detection
- Utilized ZYNQ Processing System to return RGB data over UART using C in order to manage communication between devices via serial communication 
- Implemented Python scripting with Pygame and Pyserial to create a user-friendly GUI that streamlines the transmission of data between the Zybo FPGA and the COLOR Pmod, making it easy for users to extract and analyze color data with precision and speed
